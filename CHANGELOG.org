This document contains the release notes for each tagged commit on the
project's main git repository: [[https://github.com/captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode]].

With a roadmap and issues also supplied

* ISSUES

** TODO Do not apply highlighting when frame only contains 1 window

* ROADMAP

** TODO add darken desaturated and tab highlight examples to README
** TODO define accent color hue adjustment
** TODO define compensating margin
** TODO Incorporate =mode-line-active= and =mode-line-inactive= somehow as this would make more sense especially in the 'default mode.
** TODO header-line not shown on window split - I have a funny feeling this could be very difficult, if not impossible!
** TODO restore modeline height when switching between modes
** TODO adjust the not selected-window margin to avoid little window navigation. disruption, hence translating a fringe pixel width to a number of margin characters, not quite sure how I am going to do this yet.
** TODO excess selected-window disruption in header-line. (not sure I can do much about this)
** TODO define which theme face attribute to use as the main accent color
Currently the default is to use the =highlight= face
** WATCH possible overheads of updating visual elements for each window?
** WATCH careful with removing header-line on all windows, for example magit commit window and probably some others may need to add some logic depending on mode.
