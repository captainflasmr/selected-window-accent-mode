1 Introduction
**************

1.1 Overview
============

Selected Window Accent Mode is an Emacs package that helps you keep
track of which window has focus by visually accenting it.  It applies
distinctive colors to the fringes, mode line, and potentially tabs of
the active window.

   This is particularly helpful when working with complex window layouts
or when using themes where the distinction between active and inactive
windows is subtle.

1.2 Features
============

   • Visually highlights the currently selected window
   • Multiple accent styles (default, tiling, subtle)
   • Customizable accent colors
   • Optional tab-bar integration
   • Smart borders option for single-window frames
   • Theme integration via highlight color

3 Configuration
***************

3.1 Basic Configuration
=======================

Here's a simple configuration using ‘use-package’:

     (use-package selected-window-accent-mode
       :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
       :custom
       (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 10)
       (selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
       (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle))

   This will enable the mode with a subtle style, using the current
theme's highlight color for accents and setting the fringe thickness to
10 pixels.

3.2 Using a Custom Color
========================

If you want to specify your own accent color:

     (use-package selected-window-accent-mode
       :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
       :custom
       (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 10)
       (selected-window-accent-custom-color "orange")
       (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'tiling)
       (selected-window-accent-percentage-darken 0)
       (selected-window-accent-percentage-desaturate 0)
       (selected-window-accent-tab-accent t)
       (selected-window-accent-smart-borders t))

3.3 Tweaking Theme Highlight Color
==================================

You can also use the theme's highlight color but adjust it:

       :custom
       (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 10)

       (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'tiling)
       (selected-window-accent-percentage-darken 20)
