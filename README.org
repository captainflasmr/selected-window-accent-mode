* selected-window-accent-mode

** intro

This package provides functions to accentuate and reset the active window
by changing its fringe, mode-line, and margins based on the 'highlight' face.

** documentation

To use this package, save the above code to a file called `fd-find.el` in your Emacs load path (e.g. `~/.emacs.d/lisp/`) and add the following line to your Emacs init file:

#+begin_src elisp
;; now use-package has the :vc keyword in use-package!
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :defer t
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode"))
#+end_src

For the moment just simply now:

#+begin_src elisp
(selected-window-accent-mode)
#+end_src
