* Summary

The Selected Window Accent Mode is an Emacs package designed to visually distinguish the currently selected window by applying a unique accent color to its fringes, mode line, header line, and margins.

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:selected-window-accent-mode-00.jpg]]

* Quick Start (emacs 29)

Add the following to the emacs init for a tiling window manager feel (see image above):

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode")
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 10)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color "#916941")
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'tiling))

(selected-window-accent-mode 1)
#+end_src

* Installation

** use-package (emacs 29)

Put the following into your emacs init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode"))
#+end_src

** use-package (MELPA)

- TODO (see roadmap below)

** from source

Download the `.el` file and place it in your Emacs `load-path`.

Then either manually load it or add it to your configuration to be loaded at startup.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'selected-window-accent-mode)
#+end_src

* Usage

Interactively Toggle the mode on and off =M-x selected-window-accent-mode=

Interactively change the current style =M-x switch-selected-window-accent-style= which will present a =completing-read= selection in the minibuffer

The styles that are currently supported :

- default
- tiling
- subtle

see *roadmap* below for a description.

Typically I have bound these two interactive functions to a new keymap where I keep all my emacs visual change functions.

#+begin_src elisp
(defvar my-win-keymap (make-sparse-keymap))
(global-set-key (kbd "M-o") my-win-keymap)
(define-key my-win-keymap (kbd "a") 'selected-window-accent-mode)
(define-key my-win-keymap (kbd "y") 'switch-selected-window-accent-style)
#+end_src

* Examples

** Example 1 - Default / custom color

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:selected-window-accent-mode-01.jpg]]

To enable the accent mode automatically upon starting Emacs, add the following line to your `.emacs` or `init.el` file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode")
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 20)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color "goldenrod")
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'default))

(selected-window-accent-mode 1)
#+end_src

This will accent the modeline only for the selected window with the =goldenrod= color.

** Example 2 - Tiling / custom color / custom fringe thickness

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:selected-window-accent-mode-02.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(setq selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 6)
(setq selected-window-accent-custom-color "#4179b2")
(setq selected-window-accent-mode-style 'tiling)

(selected-window-accent-mode 1)
#+end_src

This will accent the full outline of the window with the color #4179b2 more akin to a tiling window manager.

** Example 3 - Tiling / theme highlight color

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:selected-window-accent-mode-03.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(setq selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 6)
(setq selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
(setq selected-window-accent-mode-style 'tiling)

(selected-window-accent-mode 1)
#+end_src

This will accent the full outline of the window with the =highlight= color taken from the current theme.

** Example 4 - Subtle / custom fringe thickness (thick)

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:selected-window-accent-mode-04.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(setq selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 20)
(setq selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
(setq selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle)

(selected-window-accent-mode 1)
#+end_src

This will accent the modeline and just the left fringe and in this case be quite a pronounced thick accent.

* Customization

Can be done through the customization interface:

*Selected Window Accent Group group:*

   Customization group for the selected-window-accent package.

*Selected Window Accent Custom Color*

   Custom accent color for the selected window. Set this variable to change the accent color.

   - =None= - color will be using the current =highlight= face
   - =Custom Color= - input color name or Hex

*Selected Window Accent Fringe Thickness:* Integer:

   The thickness of the fringes in pixels.

*Selected Window Accent Mode*:  =Boolean=: Toggle

   Non-nil if Selected-Window-Accent mode is enabled

*Selected Window Accent Mode Style*

   Current style for accenting the selected window.

   - =default= - just modeline accent
   - =tiling= - window border accent
   - =subtle= - left and modeline accent

* Minor Mode

The =selected-window-accent-mode= is a global minor mode that you can toggle to enable or disable the accenting of the selected window.

When enabled, it distinguishes the selected window with a special accent color.

* Hooks

Two hooks are used to automatically update the window accents when the window configuration or state changes:

- window-configuration-change-hook
- window-state-change-hook

These are added when the =selected-window-accent-mode= is enabled and removed when disabled.

* TODOs / ROADMAP

  The current version is pretty rough and probably definitely pre-alpha.

  ---

  Fix these to get to a tagged Version 0.1.

  In order of priority

  TODO header-line not shown on window split.

  TODO cope better with 0 thickness

  TODO improve modeline contrast between fg and bg

  TODO adjust the not selected-window margin to avoid little window navigation. disruption, hence translating a fringe pixel width to a number of margin characters, not quite sure how I am going to do this yet.

  TODO Incorporate `mode-line-active' and `mode-line-inactive' somehow as this would make more sense especially in the 'default mode.

  TODO possible overheads of updating visual elements for each window?

  TODO excess selected-window disruption in header-line.

  WATCH careful with removing header-line on all windows, for example magit commit window and probably some others may need to add some logic depending on mode.

    ---

  <<<< roadmap >>>>

  add to MELPA

  define more custom variables:

    - accent color saturation adjustment
    - accent color darken adjustment
    - accent color hue adjustment

  define which theme face attribute to use as the main accent color

    Currently the default is to use the `highlight' face

  DOING implement accent styles

  DOING `tiling' - /top/right/bottom/left/ - typically a squished modeline and header line to a general accent thickness to provide a typical tiling window manager focussed outline experience

  DOING `subtle' - /left/bottom/
