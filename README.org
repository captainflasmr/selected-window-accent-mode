* Summary

The Selected Window Accent Mode is an Emacs package designed to visually distinguish the currently selected window by applying a unique accent color to its fringes, mode line, header line, and margins.

* Whats New

** v0.9 <2024-08-10>

Add Pywal color integration to selected-window-accent-mode to allow the accent color to be consistent with the wallpaper of the operating system.

Note: will only work on linux.

- Introduce `selected-window-accent-use-pywal` option to use a Pywal-generated color palette.
- Add `selected-window-accent--get-pywal-color` function to fetch colors from Pywal palette.
- Update logic in `selected-window-accent` function to use Pywal color if enabled.
- Require `json` package for handling Pywal palette.

#+begin_quote
Pywal is a tool on linux that generates color schemes from images, allowing users to apply these colors to their desktop and application themes for a cohesive and dynamic look.
#+end_quote

Example use:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq selected-window-accent-use-pywal t)
#+end_src

When enabled, =color1= is selected as the accent color, taken from the file : =~/.cache/wal/colors.json= which is a generic color file typically generated by pywal.

This means that the accent color can be more tied in with the current wallpaper once pywal is connected to the wallpaper change mechanism of your operating system.

Note that this feature will require an external pywal generation step, triggered on wallpaper change, examples given below.

See below for an example =colors.json= file

Technically any tool that can write to a json file in a similar format will have a carry through affect on the accent color associated with this package.  Here is an example :

#+begin_src js-json
{
    "wallpaper": "/home/jdyer/.last_wallpaper.jpg",
    "alpha": "100",

    "special": {
        "background": "#0d1a05",
        "foreground": "#c8cfdb",
        "cursor": "#c8cfdb"
    },
    "colors": {
        "color0": "#0d1a05",
        "color1": "#8FA944",
        "color2": "#165E97",
        "color3": "#5C7391",
        "color4": "#748AA6",
        "color5": "#7498C4",
        "color6": "#8D9BB1",
        "color7": "#c8cfdb",
        "color8": "#8c9099",
        "color9": "#8FA944",
        "color10": "#165E97",
        "color11": "#5C7391",
        "color12": "#748AA6",
        "color13": "#7498C4",
        "color14": "#8D9BB1",
        "color15": "#c8cfdb"
    }
}
#+end_src

On linux, install =python-pywal= using your package manager of choice.

At which point you can generate a =colors.json= with the following commands:

#+begin_src bash
wal -c
wal -i ~/.last_wallpaper.jpg -q -n
#+end_src

*** Wallpaper Change Example

Changing a wallpaper and hooking =pywal= up accordingly, which technically should work for both Wayland and X11.

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash

wallpaper_path="$(find ~/wallpaper-dir -type f | shuf -n 1)"
echo $wallpaper_path > ~/.last_wallpaper_path
cp -f $wallpaper_path ~/.last_wallpaper.jpg

if [[ $XDG_SESSION_TYPE == "x11" ]]; then
   feh --bg-scale "$wallpaper_path"
fi

if [[ $XDG_SESSION_TYPE == "wayland" ]]; then
   swww img "$wallpaper_path" --transition-step 20 --transition-fps=20
fi

# lets run pywal for colour scheme generation
wal -c
wal -i ~/.last_wallpaper.jpg -q -n
#+end_src

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-00.jpg]]

* Quick Start

To use left and bottom accent based on the themes highlight colour:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 10)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle))
#+end_src

OR define your own colour:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 10)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color "#427900")
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle))
#+end_src

* Installation

** use-package (MELPA)

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1))
#+end_src

** use-package (emacs 29)

Put the following into your emacs init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode")
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1))
#+end_src

** from source

Download the `.el` file and place it in your Emacs `load-path`.

Then either manually load it or add it to your configuration to be loaded at startup.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'selected-window-accent-mode)
(selected-window-accent-mode 1)
#+end_src

* Usage

Interactively Toggle the mode on and off =M-x selected-window-accent-mode=

A transient map is available (Emacs 28.1+):

#+begin_src elisp
(eval-after-load 'selected-window-accent-mode
  '(progn
     (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c w") 'selected-window-accent-transient)))
#+end_src

which will bring up the following transient menu:

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-transient-menu.jpg]]

The styles that are currently supported :

- default
- tiling
- subtle

see *roadmap* below for a description.

* Examples

** Example 1 - Default / custom color

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-01.jpg]]

To enable the accent mode automatically upon starting Emacs, add the following line to your `.emacs` or `init.el` file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 20)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color "goldenrod")
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'default))
#+end_src

This will accent the modeline only for the selected window with the =goldenrod= color.

** Example 2 - Tiling / custom color / custom fringe thickness

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-02.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 6)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color "#4179b2")
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'tiling))
#+end_src

This will accent the full outline of the window with the color #4179b2 more akin to a tiling window manager.

** Example 3 - Tiling / theme highlight color

Example is using the theme doom-one

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-03.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 10)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'tiling))
#+end_src

This will accent the full outline of the window with the =highlight= color taken from the current theme.

** Example 4 - Subtle / custom fringe thickness (thick)

Example is using the theme doom-one

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-04.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 20)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle))
#+end_src

This will accent the modeline and just the left fringe and in this case be quite a pronounced thick accent.

** Example 5 - Subtle / theme accent colour with darkening and desaturation

Example is using the theme doom-one

The takes the default highlight colour from the theme as before but applies darkening and desaturation.

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-05.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 20)
  (selected-window-accent-percentage-darken 10)
  (selected-window-accent-percentage-desaturate 100)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle))
#+end_src

** Example 6 - Subtle / theme accent colour with lightening and saturation and tab accent

Example is using the theme doom-one

The takes the default highlight colour from the theme as before but applies lightening and saturation along with the same colour tab accent.

#+attr_org: :width 300px
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:img/selected-window-accent-mode-06.jpg]]

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :config (selected-window-accent-mode 1)
  :custom
  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness 20)
  (selected-window-accent-percentage-darken -10)
  (selected-window-accent-percentage-desaturate -100)
  (selected-window-accent-tab-accent t)
  (selected-window-accent-custom-color nil)
  (selected-window-accent-mode-style 'subtle))
#+end_src

* Customization

** selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness

The thickness of the fringes in pixels.

This thickness is used when the ‘selected-window-accent-mode-style’ is
either tiling or subtle.

** selected-window-accent-custom-color

Custom accent color for the selected window.

When set to a color, this color will override the default highlight face background color as the accent color for the selected window.  Setting this to nil disables the custom color, reverting to the default behavior.

** selected-window-accent-mode

Non-nil if Selected-Window-Accent mode is enabled.  See the ‘selected-window-accent-mode’ command for a description of this minor mode.  Setting this variable directly does not take effect; either customize it (see the info node ‘Easy Customization’) or call the function ‘selected-window-accent-mode’.

** selected-window-accent-mode-style

Current style for accenting the selected window.

The style determines how the selected window is visually distinguished from unselected ones.

- ‘default’: No special styling, uses the default Emacs appearance.

- ‘tiling’: Accentuates the fringes and mode line of the selected window with a thicker appearance, based on ‘selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness‘.

- ‘subtle’: Adds a subtle accent to the selected window with minimal visual change.

** selected-window-accent-percentage-darken

The percentage the highlight accent is darkened.

This percentage of darkening used when the ‘selected-window-accent-custom-color’ is set to nil and hence the color is chosen from the current theme.

** selected-window-accent-percentage-desaturate

The percentage the highlight accent is saturated.

This percentage of desaturation used when the ‘selected-window-accent-custom-color’ is set to nil and hence the color is chosen from the current theme.

** selected-window-accent-tab-accent

When non-nil, the ‘selected-window-accent-tab-accent‘ is active.  Accenting the selected selected tab in the tab-bar.

** selected-window-accent-smart-borders

When non-nil, the ‘selected-window-accent-smart-borders‘ is active.  Doesn’t accent when a frame contains only a single window.

** selected-window-accent-foreground-adjust-factor

Adjustment factor for incrementing or decrementing foreground color brightness.

** selected-window-accent--use-complementary-color

Toggle complementary color for foreground based on background color.

** selected-window-accent--foreground-invert-state

Toggle inverted color for foreground based on current foreground color.

** selected-window-accent--foreground-offset

The percentage the foreground is modified.

* Minor Mode

The =selected-window-accent-mode= is a global minor mode that you can toggle to enable or disable the accenting of the selected window.

When enabled, it distinguishes the selected window with a special accent color.

* Hooks

Two hooks are used to automatically update the window accents when the window configuration or state changes:

- window-configuration-change-hook
- window-state-change-hook

These are added when the =selected-window-accent-mode= is enabled and removed when disabled.

* Design / Algorithm / Limitations

Just as a note, the overall design of this package is a little, lets just say clunky, something that has been somewhat shoehorned into the Emacs functional architecture, therefore there will be a few little quirks.  In this section I look to explain my general design ideas regarding how I achieved some kind of window highlighting / accenting and the associated limitations.

This section is mainly for me, as the maintainer of this package, but may be informative to others.  This section is to try and fully understand how I have designed this thing for when I come back and have another rethink on improvements.

Firstly it is important to define the scope of window based visual highlighting in Emacs, which hopefully will help to explain some of the limitations of this package.

It works well enough I think at the moment and I especially I tend to favour the 'subtle accent mode which inherently has the fewest issues along with providing a satisfying visually distinguishing highlighting mechanism, more bang for the buck if you will.

** Emacs repurposed elements

*** fringe

position: left, right
face-attribute: 'fringe : all-windows
size: (set-window-fringes left right) : per-window

*** header-line

position: top
value: header-line-format : per-window
face-attribute: 'header-line : all-windows
size: face-attribute :height : all-windows

*** mode-line

position: bottom
value: mode-line-format : selected-window
face-attribute: 'mode-line-active : selected-window
size: face-attribute :height : all-windows

*** tab-bar

face-attribute: 'tab-bar-tab

** Pseudo-code

#+begin_src
calculate accent colours
update global face-attributes

walk-windows
  for each window
    update window with accent or default appearance
    if window is not selected
      reset header-line to nil
      reset fringes to 0
#+end_src

** Limitations

As a header-line can only have a single global colour it does mean that the header-line-format for each window needs to be made blank in order to preserve accent consistency, this means that modes which change the header-line, such as some modes of magit and org-sticky-header will possibly have to be sacrificed for this selected-window-accent-mode to function coherently.

There is a possibility that I could add in some extra logic depending on the mode that is set, but that might be for a future version, and at this moment I'm just not sure the effort is worth it.

The accent is now always alongside an Emacs default margin so as not to overlap with existing packages that utilize the window margin settings, this would make the accent facility look a little less visually appealing then applying a little margin for the selected window along with a compensating margin for non selected windows, but this will have to be sacrificed for not disrupting other Emacs package functionality.

All non selected windows have been fringe zeroed to preserve fringe accent consistency as the fringe colour can only be set globally meaning that any Emacs packages that implement fringe functionality, which I have found to be uncommon, would show varying levels of window accents.

When a buffer is split into multiple windows in tiling mode the header line is shared, thus leading to an accented header line across all splits, this is an inherent limitation of Emacs and how it processes windows / buffers.

Phew!, that might be it, this can get quite complicated!

** What about overlays?

At the moment this package works well enough for my needs and I will think about overlays again at some point to see if I can somehow re-purpose them to fit my needs, currently it is the buffer / window scrolling that I think would always tend to look pretty clunky if implemented.

** The Future

I of course shall keep an eye on Emacs development to see if at some time in the future a more flexible per window visual facility becomes available.

* ISSUES (github)                                                    :ISSUES:

** DOING #4 Doesn't work well with other packages

*olivetti & org-sticky-header broken with selected-window-accent-mode*

I have decided to disable the setting of windows margins as part of this package as this is often used for padding in other packages.  This means I can now let packages such as olivetti-mode and visual-fill-column do their own thing without any margin interference.  Therefore this package will mainly achieve its functionality via fringe modification rather than fringe/margins.

The disadvantage of this is that on window transition there will be more of a text in buffer offset shift as the select-window-accent-mode fringe is applied to the select window without a default compensatory margin / fringe shift.  This didn't really work anyway and there was always a little shift depending on the width of the native emacs margin character vs fringe pixel size.

This means I don't have to depend on package checks and maybe packages I am unaware of that depend on window buffer margin changes will work better in the future.

Maybe I can just define a non selected window compensatory margin in the future, for now I will leave as is and see how it goes!

However this currently doesn't cover any mode that modifies a window header, like for example org-sticky-header.

** DONE #1 Do not apply highlighting when frame only contains 1 window
** DONE #3 Package breaks fringes

* ROADMAP                                                           :ROADMAP:

** TODO add darken desaturated and tab highlight examples to README
** TODO define accent color hue adjustment
** TODO define compensating margin
** TODO Incorporate mode-line-active and mode-line-inactive somehow
this would make more sense especially in the 'default mode.
** TODO header-line not shown on window split
I have a funny feeling this could be very difficult, if not impossible!
** TODO adjust the not selected-window margin to avoid little window navigation. disruption
hence translating a fringe pixel width to a number of margin characters, not quite sure how I am going to do this yet.
** TODO excess selected-window disruption in header-line. (not sure I can do much about this)
** TODO add some form of unit test
** TODO define which theme face attribute to use as the main accent color
Currently the default is to use the =highlight= face

* Testing

See CHANGELOG.org

* Alternative window highlighting packages

There exist a few Emacs packages that perform window highlighting but that don't quite provide the feature set of selected-window-accent.

selected-window-accent focusses more on clearly but non-intrusively highlighting the currently selected/focussed window by highlighting aspects of the window border without having to modify the appearance of non-selected windows, hence more akin to a tiling window manager.

** dimmer

"This package provides a minor mode that indicates which buffer is currently active by dimming the faces in the other buffers."

This is the closest in functionality to selected-window-accent, the difference being that dimmer dims non selected windows rather than accent the selected window.

dimmer can be used in conjunction and will complement selected-window-accent to further enhance the emphasizing of the selected window.

** hiwin

"This package provides a minor-mode to change the background colour of the non active window."

It uses overlays to highlight non active windows, so is similar to dimmer but is less subtle in its highlighting mechanism and hasn't been updated in excess of 10 years.

** color-theme-buffer-local

"This package lets you set a color-theme on a per-buffer basis."

Unlike dimmer and hiwin this package isn't related to the concept of a selected window but more of defining different themes for different windows to distinguish them.

** solaire-mode

"This package is designed to visually distinguish "real" buffers (i.e. file-visiting code buffers where you do most of your work) from "unreal" buffers (like popups, sidebars, log buffers, terminals, etc) by giving the latter a slightly different -- often darker -- background"

Unlike dimmer and hiwin this package isn't related to the concept of a selected window but more of distinguishing between collections of IDE like elements within Emacs.
