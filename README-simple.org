* Streamlining the Selected Window Accent Mode in Emacs

Today, I'm examining a significant refactoring of my =selected-window-accent-mode= package, which has been transformed from a feature-rich but complex tool to highlight the selected-window into a leaner, more focused implementation.

** What is Selected Window Accent Mode?

For those unfamiliar with this package, =selected-window-accent-mode= is a utility that visually distinguishes your currently active Emacs window by applying accent colors to its fringes, mode line, and other UI elements. This is particularly useful when working with multiple split windows, as it makes it immediately clear which window has focus.

** The Evolution: From Complex to Streamlined

Let's have a look at my streamlining and explore the key differences between the original version and the streamlined implementation.

*** 1. Reduced Dependencies

*Original Version:*
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'json)
(require 'color)
(require 'transient)
#+end_src

*Streamlined Version:*
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'color)
#+end_src

The new implementation drops the dependencies on =json= and =transient=, eliminating functionality related to JSON parsing (for pywal integration) and the transient interface. This makes the package lighter and reduces potential compatibility issues.

*** 2. Removed Advanced Features

Several advanced features have been removed from the streamlined version:

- *Pywal Integration*: The ability to use colors from pywal-generated palettes
- *Background Blending*: The feature to blend accent colors with window backgrounds
- *Complementary Colors*: The ability to automatically generate complementary foreground colors
- *Header Line Handling*: Special logic for header line formatting and heights

Just a note on the *Header Line Handling* - Due to technical limitations of the current implementation of Emacs it wasn't quite possible to create a tiling window manager full surrounding border, although I do have hope as I read somewhere that a header-line-active and header-line-inactive was being considered.  I also ran into problems when trying to preserve any buffer that already utilized the header-line.  So my solution?, is to just remove the calculation so in fact the 'tiling highlighting option now generates an accent around 3 sides, like a bucket!

*** 3. Simplified Color Handling

The original version had complex color manipulation functions:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun selected-window-accent--increment-color-brightness (hex-color factor)...)
(defun selected-window-accent--decrement-color-brightness (hex-color factor)...)
(defun selected-window-accent--invert-color (hex-color)...)
(defun selected-window-accent--set-foreground-color (bg-color)...)
(defun selected-window-accent-blend-colors (color1 color2 alpha)...)
#+end_src

These have been consolidated into a single, straightforward function in the new version:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun selected-window-accent--determine-foreground (bg-color)
  "Determine appropriate foreground color based on BG-COLOR brightness."
  (if (string-greaterp bg-color "#888888") "#000000" "#ffffff"))
#+end_src

*** 5. Cleaner Window Handling

The core =selected-window-accent= function has been streamlined significantly. The original version was approximately 120 lines, while the new implementation achieves the same core functionality in about 70 lines. The window handling code is more focused and easier to follow.

*** 6. Simpler Command Interface

The original package used a transient interface (similar to Magit) for its commands.

#+begin_src elisp
(transient-define-prefix selected-window-accent-transient ()
  "Transient for selected window accent."
  ["Selected Window Accent"
   ["Main"
    ("s" "Switch Style" selected-window-accent-switch-selected-window-accent-style)
    ...]])
#+end_src

The streamlined version replaces this with a simple keymap:

#+begin_src elisp
(defvar selected-window-accent-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "w") 'selected-window-accent-switch-style)
    ...
    map)
  "Keymap for selected-window-accent commands.")
#+end_src

** What Was Lost?

While the streamlined version is more efficient, it does sacrifice some functionality:

- *Foreground Color Controls*: The ability to fine-tune foreground colors with incremental adjustments
- *Complementary Color Generation*: Automatic creation of complementary color schemes
- *Background Blending*: The feature to blend accent colors with window backgrounds
- *Configuration Export*: The function to export current settings to a buffer
- *Pywal Integration*: The ability to use colors from pywal-generated palettes
- *Transient Interface*: The more sophisticated command menu

If you want to use the more function rich version, I would recommend pulling a previous version.

** Is the Simpler Version Better?

Whether the streamlined version is "better" depends on your needs:

- If you want a lightweight, focused tool that simply highlights your active window without fuss, the new version is ideal
- If you need fine-grained control over color schemes, pywal integration, or other advanced features, you might prefer the original version
