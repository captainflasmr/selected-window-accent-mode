The current version is pretty rough and probably definitely pre-alpha.

* ____________________ for 0.1 (alpha) ____________________

In order of priority - possibly eventually some will be moved to a later version.

** TODO expand emacs help / documentation
** TODO cope better with 0 thickness
** TODO Incorporate =mode-line-active= and =mode-line-inactive= somehow as this would make more sense especially in the 'default mode.
** DONE Add ChangeLog.

** DONE visual-fill-column-mode not working again!
CLOSED: [2024-01-11 Thu 17:17] DEADLINE: <2024-01-31 Wed>
** DONE improve modeline contrast between fg and bg

* ____________________ 0.2 + / roadmap ____________________

** TODO header-line not shown on window split - I have a funny feeling this could be very difficult, if not impossible!
** TODO adjust the not selected-window margin to avoid little window navigation. disruption, hence translating a fringe pixel width to a number of margin characters, not quite sure how I am going to do this yet.
** WATCH careful with removing header-line on all windows, for example magit commit window and probably some others may need to add some logic depending on mode.
** WATCH possible overheads of updating visual elements for each window?
** TODO excess selected-window disruption in header-line. (not sure I can do much about this)
** TODO add to MELPA
** TODO define more custom variables:
- accent color saturation adjustment
- accent color darken adjustment
- accent color hue adjustment
- compensating margin
** TODO define which theme face attribute to use as the main accent color
Currently the default is to use the =highlight= face
** DOING implement accent styles
*** DONE =default= - /bottom/ - full height modeline
CLOSED: [2024-01-07 Sun 21:36]
*** DOING =tiling= - /top/right/bottom/left/ - typically a squished modeline and header line to a general accent thickness to provide a typical tiling window manager focussed outline experience
*** DOING =subtle= - /left/bottom/
