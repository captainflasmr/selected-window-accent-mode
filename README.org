* intro

This package provides functions to accentuate and reset the active window
by changing its fringe, mode-line, and margins based on the 'highlight' face.

* documentation

To use this package put the following into your emacs init file as now use-package has the :vc keyword!

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :defer t
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode"))
#+end_src

and to activate:

#+begin_src elisp
(selected-window-accent-mode)
#+end_src

* BUGS
Fix these to get to a tagged Version 0.1

In order of priority

- TODO (selected-window-accent-mode) not working in init file needs to be manually run
- TODO improve documentation
- TODO careful with removing header-line on all windows for example magit commit window and probably some others may needs to add some logic depending on mode
- TODO when first built and installed we get the following errors
