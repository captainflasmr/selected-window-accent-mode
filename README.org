* selected-window-accent-mode

** intro

This package provides functions to accentuate and reset the active window
by changing its fringe, mode-line, and margins based on the 'highlight' face.

** documentation

To use this package put the following into your emacs init file as now use-package has the :vc keyword!

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
  :defer t
  :vc (:fetcher github :repo "captainflasmr/selected-window-accent-mode"))
#+end_src

and to activate:

#+begin_src elisp
(selected-window-accent-mode)
#+end_src

** FIX
*** TODO [#A] (selected-window-accent-mode) not working in init file needs to be manually run
*** TODO [#B] when first built and installed we get the following errors

#+begin_src
